# PaperStorage
PaperStorage is a project aimed at converting Computing Data into Paper Storage. We will provide you with the algorithms and software to achieve the storage in your environment. We aim to provide Computing Space or Storage for everyone with advanced algorithms.

## Computer Storage and Compression: 
In Computer, Data is stored in units called as bits. Data of words, text documents, images, audio, and video are stored in 8 bits (1 byte).
ASCII Characters (0-255) in Computer is stored in 1 byte in memory space. Computer data is stored in Binary or Machine Code, or Hexadecimal Values. Hexadecimal Characters occupy 1 byte space in memory.

Pixels are basic units of images represented in Black & White pixels of 8 bit, or Color pixel with size of 24 bits.

## 2, 4, 6 and 8 Characters Length keys to create 4294967296 Permutations:
To Create Permutations of 4294967296 Keys to use in compression process, for 2 Characters Length, 65536 Unique Characters are required to
achieve the creation of compression keys, for 4 Characters Length, 256 Unique Characters are required to create permutations of 4294967296
Keys, for 6 Characters Length, 41 Unique Characters are required to create permutations of 4294967296 and for 8 Characters Length, 16 Unique
Characters are required to create 4294967296 Permutations. Using the Encryption Keys will give advantage to map dataset in multi stage
process easily.

## Compression Keys to encode Color Codes:
To compress a dataset, we created a mapping of every four character of Hexadecimal into a color code in CSS. 65536 datasets of four character
length of Hexadecimal characters are mapped to 65536 Colors in CSS.

To Map every two colors in 65536 Colors, we can create a map of 12 length string of two consecutive sequence color codes using 4 Billion keys
for the 65536 Colors. So the total no of characters mapped in the algorithm is 8 Hexadecimal Characters.

You can use Encryption algorithms to generate encryption keys to encrypt every two pixel colors 000001000002 into a six length encryption
key using the characters "ghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!@#$%^&><_+-*/?=[]{}()~;:". The total probability of encryption keys for 45 Characters at 6
Length String is 8308429287425. The probability of arranging two color codes using Hexadecimal digits is 4294967296. We can generate 4
Billion keys to map 4 Billion Values for selected 2 Color codes in sequence.

Permutation of CSS Colors:
Total No of CSS Colors is 16777216. Arranging the total no of CSS Colors in 12 Length Character is 16 to the power of 12 is
281,474,976,710,656. So the possible permutations to arrange two 6 character hexadecimal color codes in sequence is 281,474,976,710,656.

## Hex 6 Color Compression Keys:
Read Every 3 Characters of data as ASCII Characters and convert it into ASCII Decimals and map the sequence of ASCII Decimals to a color value and convert the
RGB Code into a Hex 6 Character Color Code, and for every Hex 6 Character Color Code create mapping dictionary of 2 Character Length Custom Fonts or UTF 8
Fonts using 4096 Fonts. The permutations of Hex 6 Character is equivalent to 16777216 and which is equivalent to 2 Character Length of 4096 Cutom Fonts or 4096 UTF8
Fonts Permutations.

## Hex 4 Compression Keys:
Read Every 4 Characters of Hex Values and convert it to 2 Character Length using Permutations of 256 Custom Fonts or 256 UTF8 Fonts to create 65536
Permutations to map the 4 Character Length Permutations of Hex Values.

## ASCII 4, and ASCII 3 Compression Keys:
Read Every 4 Characters of data as ASCII and convert it into mapping 2 Character Length Custom Fonts or 2 Character Length UTF 8 Fonts made up of 65536 UTF 8
Fonts(Code Points) in various langauge fonts. The total No of ASCII 4 character is 4294967296 and which equivalent to 2 Character Length UTF 8 Fonts
Permutations of 65536.

Read Every 3 Characters of data as ASCII Characters and convert it into ascii decimals and create mapping for every 3 ASCII Characters (ASCII Decimals) into 2
Character Length using 256 Custom Fonts or 256 UTF 8 Fonts. Permutations of ASCII Decimals in 3 Character length is 16777216 equivalent to permutations of 2
Character Length made up of 4096 Custom Fonts or 4096 UTF 8 Fonts.

## Converting Data in Real World using Color Fonts or Pattern-based Fonts:
For Example, Let's take a pdf file with the words "Hello World", and we will convert the file into Binary Code or Hexadecimal or ASCII 
Characters for the data.

We will use the 255 Characters in ASCII as Binary or Hexadecimal Characters. Each Binary or Hexadecimal character will be represented by 
selected Color Codes available in CSS Color Codes. There are around 16 Million Colors you can create by combining RGB Values in real life.

ASCII Map or Hexadecimal Map of 255 Characters will be stored in multiple possibilities (Permutations) for compression purposes.

Factorial of 255 ASCII Characters will be 
255!=3350850684932979117652665123754814942022584063591740702576779884286208799035732771005626138126763314259280802118502282445926550135522251856727692533193070412811083330325659322041700029792166250734253390513754466045711240338462701034020262992581378423147276636643647155396305352541105541439434840109915068285430675068591638581980604162940383356586739198268782104924614076605793562865241982176207428620969776803149467431386807972438247689158656000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

The data on the Internet or in your home falls into the Permutation or Factorial of 255 ASCII Characters.

We will compress the data by mapping into a grid of colors for every ASCII Character in step one and in further step, we will create a new
map of data containing 255 Maps of Data. Example: 1 Map of Data will have 255 Characters mapped with 255 Color Codes.

In Step Two, We will use a new set of CSS Colors to represent the grid of 255 Color Maps and we will keep on continuing the compression till
we receive single-color images for the Dataset.

The project will use Color Fonts representing computer colors created by RGB Colors.
 
## Color Fonts:
Color Fonts will comprise individual colors in CSS Colors containing 16 Million Colors and 16 Million Colors will produce 16 Million Fonts to 
use in computing or Data Compression Algorithms. Nature is helping us to create 16 Million Color Fonts in the computer field which may 
provide unbelievable randomness to work.

How a Color Font will be created?
Color Fonts are representations of geometrical shapes like Squares, circles and more. Those shapes will be filled with every 16 Million Colors
to create 16 Million Color Fonts.

Data can be represented in different ways by using Color Fonts with different patterns for computing and storage purposes.

## Dictionary Fonts: 
In a Natural Language like English, a Dictionary may contain up to 200000 or 2 Lakh Words, which could be converted into 
2 Lakh or 200000 fonts by using different shapes or custom representations to use in computing or storage purposes.

## Algorithm for Dictionary Words: 
Lexicographical order of Dictionary Words, for example words need to be ordered in a way, Words starting with Aa, Ab, Ac, Ad,
Ae, Af, Ag, Ah, Ai, Aj, Ak, Al, Am, An, Ao, Ap, Aq, Ar, As, At, Au, Av, Aw, Ax, Ay, Az, and for the entire dictionary. Colors starting from 
000000 should be assigned as a single key for each lexicographical order of words, 2 Lakh Colors in Order should be used to map 2 Lakh Words 
in order. Words need to arranged in lexicographical order and mapped to colors from zero index.

You can take selected characters in ASCII convert them into fonts and create Datamaps in sizes of  16, 32, 64, 128, or 256 Maps for Binary or 
Hexadecimal or ASCII or UTF8 data to create Compressed Storage.

PaperStorage enables everyone to store data in a tremendous way by compressing Large Amount Data in a 8 GB pen drive in a MultiStage Compression
Environment. Application layers supporting streaming patterns of data and identifying the datasets using Image Recognition 
techniques and AI will provide more performance to internet users and Desktop Computer Applications.

## Algorithm to color code ASCII and Hexadecimal Values:

A Color Code will be created using decimal values of ascii characters or 2 sequence Hexadecimal values mapped to 255 ascii characters. 
Data will be arranged in three character sequence, and decimal value of ascii or corresponding decimal value for Hexadecimal Two Character 
Length in first character will be assigned Red color of Color Code, and the decimal value of second character will be assigned as Green, 
and the decimal value of third character will be assigned as Blue. The three character sequence will form a RGB code of a color, which will 
be used to create the pattern.
